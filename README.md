fw-Xtractor is a tool to extract and squash firmware files from the vendor partition in Android. It serves as an alternative to droid-juicer, which may not work on some devices using dynamic partitions.

## üöÄ HOW TO USE:
1. Clone this repository using Termux or download it as a ZIP file in any terminal app of your choice.
2. Extract the ZIP and cd into the repository directory.
3. Download or create a droid-juicer-compatible .toml file for your device.
4. Run the script with root access: `./fw-Xtractor <vendor,codename-variant>.toml`
5. The script will extract and squash the MDT files, then copy them into an output/ directory.
6. You can copy all contents from the output/ directory to your Linux rootfs at: /lib/firmware/updates/
7. Alternatively, you can place the firmware files in the Linux ramdisk, or boot into your Linux distro and regenerate the ramdisk with: `update-initramfs -u`
